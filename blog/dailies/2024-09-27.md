## Where I focused today
- Started adding packages I want to install and ToDos to [Droplet Home](Droplet%20Home)

## What I accomplished
- Added new ssh key to SearxNG
- Got github
	- Github: https://github.com/Dokza0000/confluence-of-thoughts
	- Pages: https://dokza0000.github.io/confluence-of-thoughts/
  Got goaccess running on SearxNG

## Tidbits
- Locked myself out of my droplet it seems. The Digital Ocean regular console is not working. Had to use the Recovery Console to wget to download public key that I uploaded to file.io
